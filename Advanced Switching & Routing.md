Welcome to the home page for the Advanced Switching & Routing Year 3 Semester 1 Module. This page serves as a hub to all note pages relating to Year 3 Semester 1 Networking.

This module aims to:  
- To give students practical skills to plan, configure and verify the implementation of complex enterprise LAN, WAN and IPv6 routing solutions, using a range of routing protocols.  
- To give students a theoretical understanding of scalable technologies used in building large "internetworks" such as **[[EIGRP]]**, **[[OSPF]]** and **[[BGP & eBGP]]**.  
- To give students a theoretical understanding of the techniques and technologies required to plan, configure, and verify the implementation of complex **enterprise switching solutions** and on **redistribution** of various protocols.

In case you need a refresher, below is a list of Cisco commands which may be useful during practical lab sessions, whether it be on custom configured lab desktop machines or on your laptop, these commands can help with basic device configurations:

- [[Basic Router & Switch Configuration]]
- [[Routing Configuration]]
- [[DHCP]]
- [[NAT]]
- [[ACL]]
- [[Switches]]
